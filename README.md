--the end of an era, the hw bot is patched. i will probablly fix it but wont release the fix due to not wanting it to be patched.

-- As of right now login is possibly broken on chrome, use firefox


-- Homework bot may be patched, will see if its just something on the client side but the teacher still sees it as complete

-- Medals seem to still increase when using the homework bot, most probabistically still going to mark as complete on teachers end

-- I think my german teacher gave up on giving me homework so i cant work on the homework bot

-- generating medals now takes alot longer than it used to due to a change on languagenuts end (probably to patch this) it also doesent show up instantly

Languagenut cheat 🗣️🗣️🔥🔥

Theoretically a hacked client for languagenut

You may need a CORS bypass for some features
